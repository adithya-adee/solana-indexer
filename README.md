# SolStream
SolStream is an open-source, high-performance Solana indexing SDK written in Rust. It allows developers to build custom indexers by simply providing an Anchor IDL and writing their business logic. The SDK handles the heavy lifting: RPC polling, transaction fetching, and IDL-based decoding.
